            <h2>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2><br>
            <p class="content">
                Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a combination of skills, technologies, and practices used to create and manage the structure, design, and functionality of websites. Web development can range from creating simple static web pages to complex, dynamic web applications.

Here are some key components and concepts associated with web development:<br><br>

<div class="content">1. Front-End Development (Client-Side):
   - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):Defines the structure and content of web pages.
   - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):Controls the presentation and layout of HTML elements, providing styling and design.
   - JavaScript:A programming language that enables interactive and dynamic features on the client side. It allows for things like form validation, animations, and communication with servers.
</div><br>
<div class="content"> Back-End Development (Server-Side):
   - Server-Side Languages:Such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, Node.js, etc., are used to handle server-side logic and data processing.
   - Databases: Storage solutions like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc., are used to store and retrieve data.
   - Server: A server is a computer or system that responds to requests from clients. It processes business logic, interacts with databases, and sends responses back to the client.
</div><br>
<div class="content">
3. Full-Stack Development:
   - Full-stack developers work on both the front-end and back-end aspects of a web application. They have a broader range of skills and can handle end-to-end development.
</div><br>
<div class="content">
4. Web Frameworks:
   - Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end development, and Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, and Express.js for back-end development, provide pre-built structures and tools to streamline development.
</div><br>
<div class="content">
5. Version Control:
   - Tools like Git are used to track changes in code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of the project.
</div><br>
<div class="content">
6.Web Hosting and Deployment:
   - Websites and web applications need to be hosted on servers. Services like AWS, Heroku, and Netlify provide hosting solutions. Deployment is the process of making the application accessible to users on the internet.
</div><br>
<div class="content">
7. Web Standards and Best Practices:
   - Following standards like HTTP/HTTPS protocols, accessibility guidelines, and best practices for security, performance, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) are crucial.
</div><br>
<div class="content">
8. Responsive Design:
   - Ensuring that websites and applications work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.
</div><br>


<div class="content">
Web development is a broad field with many specialized roles, such as front-end developer, back-end developer, full-stack developer, and more. It's an ever-evolving field, with new technologies and tools regularly emerging.

                    HTML CONTENT:
                </h2><br>
                <div id="new"><iframe  class="video" width="550" height="315"
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsDoLVMnmZs">
            </iframe></div>
            <br><br>
                <p class="content">Most HTML elements are a member of one or more content categories these categories group elements that share common characteristics. This is a loose grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the categories' shared behavior and their associated rules, especially when you come upon their intricate details. It's also possible for elements to not be a member of any of these categories.

                    There are three types of content categories:
                    
                    Main content categories, which describe common rules shared by many elements.
                    Form-related content categories, which describe rules common to form-related elements.
                    Specific content categories, which describe rare categories shared only by a few elements, sometimes only in a specific context.<br>
                    Metadata content
                    Elements belonging to the metadata content category modify the presentation or the behavior of the rest of the document, set up links to other documents, or convey other out-of-band information.
                    Elements belonging to this category are Flow content.<br>
                    Flow content is a broad category that encompasses most elements that can go inside the  element, including heading elements, sectioning elements, phrasing elements, embedding elements, interactive elements, and form-related elements. It also includes text nodes (but not those that only consist of white space characters).
                    The flow elements are:
                    Sectioning content
                    Sectioning content is a subset of flow content, and can be used everywhere flow content is expected. Elements belonging to the sectioning content model create a section in the current outline that defines the scope of  elements, elements, and heading content.
                    Heading content
                    Heading content is a subset of flow content, which defines the title of a section, whether marked by an explicit sectioning content element, or implicitly defined by the heading content itself. Heading content can be used everywhere flow content is expected.</p>

                    <p class="content">The content CSS property replaces content with a generated value. It can be used to define what
                         is rendered inside an element or pseudo-element. For elements, the content property specifies whether the element renders normally (normal or none) or is replaced with an image (and associated "alt" text). For pseudo-elements and margin boxes,
                         content defines the content as images, text, both, or none, which determines whether the element renders at all.

                                 are comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.
